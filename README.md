# Product List

ProductList is a modern, responsive web application built from scratch using React and Vite. The project showcases a fully designed and interactive product listing interface with a clean and polished UI. It is styled using TailwindCSS, ensuring responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
